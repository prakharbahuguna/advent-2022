# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

These are my solutions for the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
which I'm writing in Rust to get more practice with the language. The code here
is "just enough" to obtain the solution, so expect no error handling and _very_
liberal use of `unwrap()` to keep things simple.

I've also added in the input files that I've received from the site so I can
retest as necessary.
